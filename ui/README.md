# Poker planning UI

UI layer of the poker planning app, using [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/). I chose solid because it seems interesting and I wanted to get my hands on it. So far it seems easier to reason with in relation to React and Angular (the frameworks in which I have some/extensive experience).

This project is test covered by the e2e folder.
